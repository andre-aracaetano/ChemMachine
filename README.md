Here we have a Python code that, using the skitleearn library, we were able to train 3 machine learning models for laboratory predictions.

We made the most simple code to use.

If you don't have a dataset you would use our dataset example.

Follow the steps:

1. Run the libraries
2. Run the functions
3. If the libraries and functions run without problems import your dataset.xlsx or dataset.csv
4. Now we will process your data. Change the variables "df" to the name of you dataset.
5. Change the variable "suas_colunas" to the columms with numbers without comma.
6. Next, the variable "df1_alt" will remove the columms do you not use.
7. Now you will change the FEATURES and the TARGETS to the columms of do you wanna use.
8. After all, you just need to check if the lines of the code are running correctly.
9. In this chase, our code have 3 models. Soo the time to run the predicts will change because the Gaussian Process are really heavy.
10. Finally, use the code conscientiously and thank you.
