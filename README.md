Here we have a Python code that, using the sklearn library, we were able to train 3 machine learning models for laboratory predictions.

We have made the simplest code to use.

If you don't have a dataset, use our example dataset.

Follow the steps:

1. Run the libraries
2. Run the functions
3. If the libraries and functions run without problems, import your dataset.xlsx or dataset.csv.
4. Now we are going to process your data. Change the variable "df" to the name of your dataset.
5. Change the variable "suas_colunas" to the columns with numbers without commas.
6. Next, the variable "df1_old" will remove the columns that you do not use.
7. Now you'll change the FEATURES and the TARGETS to the columns you want to use.
8. Finally, all you need to do is check that the lines of code are working correctly.
9. In this case, our code has 3 models. Soo the time to run the predictions will change because the Gaussian process are really hard.
10. Finally, use the code conscientiously and thank you.
